# mjz_esp32_os

 an open source operating system kernel for running wrench  byte code in a esp32 / esp32s3 microcontroller 
 with command line interface and a file system 

info:
this operating system is mainly for the  esp32s3
and the esp32 



if i got some time i would  clean up all of the code .

uploading  the bin file of the operating system :
download main bin and esptool and if you dont have the derives  install them (https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers  or 
https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH343SER_EXE.html )
and use the pictures (Screenshot 2023-08-24 160756.png) for guidance on how to upload  the  code 
and dont forget to select the COM port 


password of the operating system administrator:
the sudo password  is "toor_pass"
 and the dev password  is obviously for devs and you can easily change the hash of hash in the code for your own  (use the  mjz_Str.hash 2 times or mjz_Str.mjz_hash(1)
 )






note  :
it uses many libraries  and there are  so many of them  i cant list them (sorry)
( and for my bad use of find & replace some of the licenses are charged (sorry)
( i dont want to credit the code that is obviously  not mine )

the repo is in its semy beta soo many comments  are unused code 
if you want to help me in this journey  time is limited  my school  will begin at the end of summer  and the repo  my be forgotten  
i know  a  bit about c/c++ and and a little  about css html  (please forgive me if my code is bad )
some of my code especially the string lib is from the Arduino built-in libs and some is from a time that i coded in code blocks  so some functions  are out dated and for my lack of time  and my ideas that don't exist i cant clean up my mess  

( note : mjz is the first word's of my  real name )








challenges for you  : 
if you can Crack  the operating system's original dev password  and put it in the issues  :) you can't
