note :
ignore the "#" for commands 
for resons (mainly my lack of time)
use only abslote paths that start with /
and if  you want to set a path to a folder please use / at the end 

example :
file -> /main.bin , /main  , /main.bin.wr 
folder -> /src/ , /main/src/ , /main/boot/
error -> src , src/ , ../ , .. , main.bin , /main// , //

if you want the full list of the commands:
#   help
